# 🎓 Egyptian Thanaweya Amma Students – Data Analysis Project

*A complete end-to-end analysis of high-school (3rd Sec) student performance across Egypt*

---

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes Egyptian Thanaweya Amma (High School) students’ performance using a realistic educational dataset. The goal is to extract insights about student achievement, compare performance across regions, genders, and school types, and uncover patterns that can guide educational improvement.

The project demonstrates skills in:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Power BI dashboard creation
* Analytical storytelling

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Python** (pandas, numpy)
* **Power BI** (interactive reports)
* **Excel** (initial validation)
* **DAX** (KPIs & calculated measures)
* **SQL** (Data Modeling)

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

### Steps Taken

* Removed missing or incomplete records
* Standardized governorate names
* Converted numerical fields and fixed percentages
* Recalculated missing Total Score values
* Adjusted Arabic text answers into numbers (like study_hours and sleep_hours)
* Removed unrealistic outliers

### Python Code

- *All python cleaning code is attached in the Repository in the (Data_Cleaning) folder.*

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Questions Explored

* Best and worst performing governorates
* Performance differences between private and public schools
* Gender-based performance trends
* Subject difficulty & failure rates
* Correlation between subjects
* Variation in track performance

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Summary
The Power BI report is organized into **five interactive dashboards**, each focusing on a different analytical dimension of student performance. The structure reflects a complete 360° view of academic, behavioral, and regional patterns.

### 1) Summary & Overall Performance
Provides a **high-level overview** of student outcomes, including general performance indicators and overall trends across the dataset.

### 2) Academic & School Factors
Explores how **academic tracks, school types, and institutional differences** influence student performance and outcomes.

### 3) Study Habits & Challenges
Focuses on **behavioral and study-related patterns**, highlighting how study habits, difficulties, and learning approaches affect results.

### 4) Lifestyle & Grades
Analyzes **non-academic lifestyle factors** and their impact on performance, offering insights into the relationship between daily habits and academic achievement.

### 5) Map
Visualizes geographic insights through **regional comparisons**, helping reveal how performance varies across governorates.
